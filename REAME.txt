Code for fast projecting a bipartite network

Compile with './compile.sh'

Input:

Bipartite network file network_file with line syntax [node feature weight] to be projected on the nodes.

Output:
1. bip_file_aggregated.txt is the bipartite network without features which appear only once
2. projected.txt is the unipartite network


-f [string]: name of the network file [node feature weight]
-outfolder [string]: name of outfolder. default is cwd.
-cf [int]: number of candidates per feature. Default is 1000
-neigh [int]: minimum number of neighbors which are printed for each node. Default is 10
-th [float]: cosine similarity threshold. Values higher than this are printed. Default is 0.3
-cosine use this flag to use cosine similarity intead of random walk similarity
-okself prints self-loops too (rw only).

Basic example: 
./bin/fast_project -f [network_file]
